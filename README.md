This is a learning project to write a raytracer in Common Lisp.  I am following along with the Youtube tutorial by Alexander Lehmann at [Writing a Raytracer in Common Lisp - Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1oMRw04W3E).

This code is largely the code that he creates over the course of the 4 part Youtube series.  I make a few minor changes, where I see fit, including building the project with Quicklisp, rather than straight ASDF.
